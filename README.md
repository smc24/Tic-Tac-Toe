# Project #1: Tic Tac Toe
## Description
What I created here is a really simple game of tic tac toe. Built for the purpose of distracting little children or to pass time.

Here's the link to my game: [Tic Tac Toe](file:///C:/Users/dbsha/sei/projects/tic-tac-toe/Tic-Tac-Toe/index.html)

## User Stories
 * As a user, I should be able to start a new tic tac toe game

		     (HTML) => 'start new' element

## Technologies Used
I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build the overall game.

For my blueprint, I decided to draw it out the old fashion way. Good ole paper and pen.

I used the Notepad word processor to create and plan out my user stories.

## Getting Started
* I created a blueprint of how I wanted my game to be set up. I didn't take too much time on this. I figured I would end up making changes along the way.
* For about 15 minutes, I planned out my user stories. This helped me transition into psuedo coding.
* I then created a file on my machine with a the following files: 
    - index.html
    - style.css
    - func.js
* I made my repository on my personal GitHub cloned it, then added my existing file.
